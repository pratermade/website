## Welcome! 

{{< lead >}}
Join me in my adventures in crafting, building and sharing knowledge.
{{< /lead >}}
Dive into a world of creativity, innovation, and practical know-how. This site is divided into two main sections:

[Posts](/posts/): Thoughtfully crafted articles that explore projects, ideas, and techniques in depth. These polished pieces are perfect for when you're looking to learn, build, or be inspired.

[Projects](/projects/): A living collection of categorized notes, sketches, and ideasâ€”a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the messy, exciting process of making things. Think of it as the workshop where ideas are born and refined. Pages in here change often, and are a bit of a mess, but are hopefully useful for my reference and for your inspiration. 

Please, come in, make yourself at home, make a mess and you don't even have to clean up your work area before you leave.
