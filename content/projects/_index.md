## Explore the Projects Section
Welcome to the heart of experimentation and hands-on learning. This section is a living collection of notes, ideas, and ongoing projects—an unpolished, raw look at the creative process. Here, you'll find categorized thoughts, sketches, and updates that document the journey of building, tinkering, and refining.

The Projects section is less about finished products and more about the evolution of concepts and the challenges faced along the way. It’s an open space for sharing what works, what doesn’t, and everything in between. If you're looking for inspiration or insights into the process behind the scenes, this is where you’ll find it.

Jump in, explore the chaos, and maybe get inspired to start your own project.

**Warning**
This section will be chaotic, messy, badly spelled and generally, a disorganized mess. The point of this section is to capture references and share knowledge. It is not complete well presented articles. See [posts](/posts) for that sort of content. 

**Here there be dragons!**

You've been warned.
